### Credits

To avoid dependency issues this project should contain everything it requires: TextMeshPro, the 2D packages, this [Tween package]("https://github.com/jeffreylanters/unity-tweens") and assets from [Retro Windows GUI]("https://comp3interactive.itch.io/retro-windows-gui") pack. The package cache has been deleted to reduce the project size so the first launch may take a while.
